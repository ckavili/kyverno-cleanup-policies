## Kyverno Cleanup Policies

Kyverno policies that can scale down / report:

- Workbenches
- Pipelines (running pods that run too long) (and pipelines scheduled to run too often)
- InferenceServices for Model Serving
- Ray Clusters
- Deployments using GPUs (LLMs or similar)
- Any other resources that might have been created and results in a constantly running pod. Apps, microservices, databases, etcâ€¦ 
- Cronjobs also need to be auto-turned off after a while. 

Policies only check the object in the time of admission, not continously. Therefore it is not possible to do constant time bound checks on the object out of the box. By utilizing `CleanupPolicies` with specific schedule, we can use the deletion event as the trigger for mutation policies.
